PASTML infers ancestral states on a phylogenetical tree with annotated tips.

usage: PASTML -a ANNOTATION_FILE -t TREE_NWK [-m MODEL] [-o OUTPUT_ANNOTATION_FILE] [-n OUTPUT_TREE_NWK]

required arguments:
   -a ANNOTATION_FILE                  path to the annotation csv file containing tip states
   -t TREE_NWK                         path to the tree file (in newick format)

optional arguments:
   -o OUTPUT_ANNOTATION_FILE           path where the output annotation csv file containing node states will be created
   -n OUTPUT_TREE_NWK                  path where the output tree file will be created (in newick format)
   -m MODEL                            state evolution model (JC or F81)
