# Dataset

The dataset is derived from the HIV-1 subtype C strains, which was subjected to the phylodynamics analysis performed in Ishikawa et al. (2018).
The phylogenetic tree (tree.nwk) was inferred from the 3,036 subtype C *pol* sequences and 35 reference outgroup non-C sequences (subtype A and K). 
The annotations (data.tab) include samplin dates, subtypes, location (country, region and continent), and the presence or absence of the Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutations (SDRMs) in the alignment.

Please see the paper in details.
