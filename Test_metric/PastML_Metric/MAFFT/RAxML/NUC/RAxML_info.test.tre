IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 20 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file HumanH1N1_1337_H3N2_147_HA_NorthAme_nuc_mafft_pos.phy.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
