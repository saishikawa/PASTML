IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences t999 and t1000 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file 1001.tips.1000bp.hky.phy.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
