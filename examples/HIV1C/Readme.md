# Dataset

The dataset contained in this directory is derived from the HIV-1 subtype C strains, which was studied in Ishikawa et al. (2018).
The phylogenetic tree (tree.nwk) was inferred from the 3,036 subtype C *pol* sequences and 35 reference outgroup non-C sequences (subtype A and K).The annotations (data.tab) include samplin dates, subtypes, location (country, region and continent), and the presence or absence of the Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutations (SDRMs) in the alignment.
